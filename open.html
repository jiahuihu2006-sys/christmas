      <h1>MERRY CHRISTMAS MY LOVE!</h1>
      <p>Today is our first Christmas together, we haven’t even been together for that long yet… but it sure does feel like we’ve been together for years! You’ve made me so happy the past two months that we’ve been together and I know you’ll make me very happy for many more months (and hopefully years) to come. You have a way of making me feel like the luckiest girl in the world.</p>
      <p>Every day that I spend with you is special to me. Even if we don’t call, or talk a lot, I treasure every moment that I can get with you. They’re all just as special to me as the days that we do call, and talk a lot. As corny as it sounds, my feelings for you grow by the day, and I don’t think that will ever happen.</p>
      <p>My only wish for Christmas is for you to be happy as much as possible… and hopefully I get to stand with you throughout it all, if you’ll have me. </p>
      <p>Hopefully this letter will make it seem like we’re a little closer for Christmas. As always, I love you. And I will continue to love you the days, weeks, months to come. Mwah!!!</p>
      <p class="signature">Forever yours ♡</p>
